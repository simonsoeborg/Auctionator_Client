# Auctionator Client
Version 1.0.0.

Written in Kotlin lang using Jetpack Compose Multiplatform framework and jSpace as a Java library.

## Requirements
Java JDK 14 or later (Written and built in Java JDK 17)
### Usage
The server must always be running before clients started. The clients will crash if there aren't any server to connect to.

Both server and client must run from the same host (Localhost)

## Installation
### Windows
Run the Auctionator_Installer.msi installer from the root of the project.

This file will properly install a program on your windows desktop.

Execute Auctionator.exe from the installation path.

### Linux and Mac
From IntelliJ it should be possible to create a package to .deb and .dmg files but we havn't tested it.

We would recommend running a client from IntelliJ.
